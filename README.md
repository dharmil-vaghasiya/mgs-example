# Mongo Golang Search Example
This repository serves as an example project demonstrating the usage of the Mongo Golang Search (MGS) library, originally created by [Antonio López](https://github.com/ajclopez). MGS simplifies the process of converting URL query parameters into MongoDB filter queries, making it easier for developers to handle database queries based on web request inputs.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this example repository is to showcase how developers can effectively utilize the MGS library in their Golang projects. It includes a Get route that queries products from the database, allowing users to experiment with the utility of the library and understand its functionalities.

## Usage
To get started, clone this repository and explore the provided example code. You can modify the example to fit your specific use case or integrate it into your own Golang projects.

## Original Library
The original MGS library developed by [Antonio López](https://github.com/ajclopez) can be found at https://github.com/ajclopez/mgs. It provides the core functionality for converting URL query parameters to MongoDB queries in Golang.

## Blog
For further insights into how to effectively use the MGS library and understand its capabilities, refer to the accompanying blog post [Here](https://medium.com/@dharmilvaghasia3675/effortless-mongodb-query-handling-in-golang-exploring-mgs-library-62b9b6007da2). This blog provides detailed examples and explanations, helping developers grasp the full potential of MGS in their projects.
